# Palmer-Penguins-Analysis
Exploring data analysis using Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy

## Base
Since it was my first attempt at analyzing a Data Set, I focused on one variable and tried finding reasons of those changes (if it had any noticable changes). Before I get started I just printed out the the type of entries (NumPy ndarray) and the amounts of rows and columns. Afterwards I printed the first instance to check if the header of the Palmer Penguins File gets skipped.

## Bill Length
As already told, I focused on one variable and that one was the Bill Length, which was a Float-Value represented in Millimeters (in the file it was called "bill_length_mm").
First I printed out all information about it and its correlations. To avoid the problems of NaN-Values I had to use the nan-methods, because there were some entities without any specific details.
